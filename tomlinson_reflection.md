What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was struggling with using a fast and easy git workflow. There were command that I did not know exactly how to use or exactly what they did. 

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Concepts that were clarified during my GPS were how to quickly and easily navigate through the git and github workflows, what each commands means and exactly when to use them. In addition, I also learned how to solve merge conflicts and how to use a pull request with another developer. 

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked my pair and guide the difference between stage and add, when to merge a pull reuqest and who's "job" it is, when to use the dot and -A, and other such questions about specific commands and git/github workflow. 

What still confuses you about Git?
I really just need to get comfortable with git. As most of it is starting to make since, I feel that git will not be confusing when I am completely comfortable using it and understanding it's messages. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I loved the Guided Pairing Session. At first my pair and I seemed to both have some nerves about working with another and feelng comfrtable to ask questions - but the GPS really gives you and idea of where you should be, how to ask questions, and overall gets you comfrtable with working with other people.
