* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    *  cloning a repository and using fetch, pull, and push
    
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    *   the git add -A function was pretty great. additionally, origin / remote was pretty great. I also got a nice orientation to github- previously it was pretty confusing, but I've found it to actually be pretty simple.
    
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    * asked guide to clarify if stage and add were the same thing.
    * I asked about adding "add ." and found out that its better to use add -A.
    * I asked my pair about cloning a repository
    * asked about the syntax around git push and pull with regard to origin/remote terminology.
    
* What still confuses you about Git?
    - the difference in code used between pulling down from a repository
    
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
    - really great- I was very, very, very nervous, but my pair was incredibly calm, patient, and on point with her command of the git/github/terminal. Our guide was pretty great as well!
